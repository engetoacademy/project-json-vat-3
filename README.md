## Task:
Implement an application in Java that will print out three EU countries with the lowest
and three EU countries with the highest standard VAT rate as of today within the EU.

## Input:
`http://jsonvat.com/` (API)

## Suggestions:
Keep it clean and simple, but with a reasonable design allowing for future extendibility.
Use any library of your choice, verify the program correctness.

## Bonus:
For Java, implement as a Maven or Gradle project.

## Hint:
We are looking for clean and elegant code, not for a full fledged application. Think well about the functional requirements and edge cases. Simple console app (but well designed) is enough. Test driven approach is a big plus.
